# Headings

HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, with `<h1>` being the highest (most important) level and `<h6>` the lowest.

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Sub-subheading</h3>
```

Headings are block-level elements. This means:

- They start on a new line
- They take up the full width available by default
- Browsers typically add margins before and after headings

## Best practice:
- Use headings hierarchically and avoid skipping levels.
