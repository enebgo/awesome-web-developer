# Paragraphs

The `<p>` element is used to define paragraphs.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

Paragraphs act as the default block-level element.

## Usage and Best Practices:

### Semantic Structure

Use `<p>` elements to group related sentences and thoughts.

### Nesting

Paragraphs cannot contain other block-level elements, including other paragraphs.

### Whitespace Handling

Browsers collapse multiple whitespace characters into a single space within paragraphs.
   ```html
    <p>This    paragraph    has    extra    spaces    but    will    render    normally.</p>
   ```
### SEO Implications:
  - Well-structured content with proper use of paragraphs can improve readability and potentially benefit SEO.
  - Search engines may give more weight to text at the beginning of paragraphs, so consider placing important keywords there.
