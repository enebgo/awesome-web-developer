## Web Basics

### The Internet in a Nutshell

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that has revolutionized how we communicate, access information, and conduct business. At its core, it's a vast system that allows data to be transmitted between devices anywhere in the world.

#### Key Components

1. **Infrastructure**: The physical layer of the Internet.
    - Fiber optic cables (e.g., transatlantic cables like MAREA)
    - Satellite networks (e.g., Starlink)
    - Cellular networks (4G, 5G)
    - Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)

2. **Protocols**: Standardized rules for data communication.
    - TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

3. **Servers**: High-performance computers that store, process, and distribute data.
    - Web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
    - Database servers (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    - Application servers (e.g., Tomcat, Node.js)

4. **Clients**: End-user devices that request and receive data.
    - Desktop computers, smartphones, IoT devices

#### Key Concepts

##### 1. IP Address

A numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

- **IPv4**: 32-bit address space (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address space (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

```
IPv4: 192.168.1.1
IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334 (compressed form)
```

##### 2. Domain

Human-readable names mapped to IP addresses through the Domain Name System.

- **Structure**: `[subdomain.]domain.TLD`
- **Example**: `www.example.com`
    - `www` - subdomain
    - `example` - second-level domain
    - `com` - Top-Level Domain (TLD)

##### 3. URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.

- **Structure**: `scheme:[//[user:password@]host[:port]][/]path[?query][#fragment]`
- **Example**: `https://api.example.com:8080/v1/users?active=true#info`
    - `https://` - scheme
    - `api.example.com` - host
    - `:8080` - port
    - `/v1/users` - path
    - `?active=true` - query
    - `#info` - fragment

##### 4. Protocol

A set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices.

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems
- **FTP**: Standard network protocol used for file transfer between a client and server
- **SMTP**: Internet standard for email transmission

##### 5. DNS (Domain Name System)

A hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.

- **Process**:
    1. User enters "www.example.com" in browser
    2. Recursive DNS resolver queries root nameserver
    3. Root server responds with TLD nameserver (.com)
    4. TLD nameserver provides authoritative nameserver for example.com
    5. Authoritative nameserver returns IP address for www.example.com
    6. Resolver returns IP address to client
    7. Client establishes connection with the IP address

```shell
dig +trace www.example.com
```

This command demonstrates the DNS resolution process, showing each step from root to authoritative nameserver.

### The World Wide Web

The **World Wide Web (WWW)**, commonly known as the Web, is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. It has revolutionized the way people communicate, access information, and conduct business globally. Invented by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, the Web has become an integral part of modern life and has transformed nearly every aspect of society.


#### Key Components of the Web

1. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**: The standard language used to create web pages.
2. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: The protocol for transmitting data over the Web.
3. **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)**: Unique addresses for web resources.
4. **Web browsers**: Software applications used to access and navigate the Web.
5. **Web servers**: Computers that host websites and respond to requests from browsers.

#### Evolution of the Web

##### Web 1.0 (1989-2004)
- Static HTML websites
- Limited user interaction
- One-way communication from website to user

##### Web 2.0 (2004-2014)

### Web Browser Architecture

#### Core Components of a Web Browser

Modern web browsers are complex pieces of software composed of several key components:

1. User Interface
2. Browser Engine
3. Rendering Engine
4. JavaScript Engine
5. Networking Component
6. UI Backend
7. Data Storage

For developers, the most relevant components are the Browser Engine, Rendering Engine, and JavaScript Engine.

#### Browser and Rendering Engines

The Browser Engine (also known as the Layout Engine) is responsible for coordinating between the UI, the rendering engine, and other parts of the browser.

The Rendering Engine is responsible for displaying the requested content. It parses HTML and CSS and displays the parsed content on the screen.

The main rendering engines are:

1. **Blink**: An open-source engine developed as part of the Chromium project. It powers:
    - Google Chrome
    - Microsoft Edge (since 2020)
    - Opera (since 2013)
    - Brave
    - Vivaldi
    - Many other Chromium-based browsers

2. **Gecko**: An open-source engine developed by Mozilla. It powers:
    - Firefox
    - Tor Browser

3. **WebKit**: An open-source engine developed by Apple. It powers:
    - Safari
    - All browsers on iOS (due to Apple's restrictions)

#### JavaScript Engines

The JavaScript Engine is a crucial component that parses and executes JavaScript code. The main JavaScript engines are:

1. **V8**: Developed by Google, used in:
    - Google Chrome
    - Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.)
    - Node.js

2. **SpiderMonkey**: Developed by Mozilla, used in:
    - Firefox

3. **JavaScriptCore** (also known as Nitro): Developed by Apple, used in:
    - Safari
    - Other WebKit-based browsers

4. **Chakra**: Developed by Microsoft, formerly used in Internet Explorer and pre-Chromium Microsoft Edge

#### The Relationship Between Engines

It's important to note that rendering engines and JavaScript engines work together but are separate components:

- Chrome and Chromium-based browsers use Blink for rendering and V8 for JavaScript execution.
- Firefox uses Gecko for rendering and SpiderMonkey for JavaScript.
- Safari uses WebKit for rendering and JavaScriptCore for JavaScript.

#### Impact on Web Development

1. **Performance Optimization**: Different engines may have varying performance characteristics, affecting how your code runs.

2. **Feature Support**: New web APIs and features might be implemented in some engines before others.

3. **Debugging**: Browser-specific developer tools are tailored to their respective engines.

4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Despite increasing standardization, differences between engines can still cause inconsistencies in how web pages are rendered or how JavaScript behaves.

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Knowing the capabilities of different engines helps in implementing graceful fallbacks for unsupported features.

##### The Trend Towards Engine Consolidation

In recent years, there's been a trend towards consolidation in the browser engine landscape, with many browsers adopting Blink and V8:

- **Benefits**: More consistent rendering and JavaScript behavior across many browsers, potentially simplifying development and testing.
- **Concerns**: Reduced diversity in the browser ecosystem, which some argue could lead to a single entity having too much influence over web standards.

##### Staying Informed

As a web developer, it's crucial to stay updated on the latest developments in browser engines:

- Follow browser release notes and roadmaps
- Participate in beta testing programs for major browsers
- Keep an eye on Web Standards discussions and proposals

### Web Hosting: Bringing Your Website to Life

Once you've developed your website, the next crucial step is to make it accessible to users on the internet. This is where web hosting comes in. This chapter will explore the concept of web hosting, different types of hosting services, and key considerations for choosing the right hosting solution for your project.

#### What is Web Hosting?

Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide the technologies and services needed for a website to be viewed on the internet.

#### How Web Hosting Works

1. You create your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).
2. You upload these files to a web server provided by your hosting company.
3. The web host connects your site to the internet, making it accessible to users worldwide.
4. When someone types your domain name into their browser, the browser contacts the web server and requests your website files.
5. The server sends these files back to the user's browser, which then renders the website.

#### Types of Web Hosting

##### 1. Shared Hosting
- Multiple websites share resources on a single server.
- Pros: Affordable, easy to set up and manage.
- Cons: Limited resources, potential security risks.

#### Domain Names and DNS

While not strictly part of hosting, domain names are closely related:

- A domain name is your website's address on the internet (e.g., www.example.com).
- You typically purchase domain names separately from your hosting (though some hosts offer them as a package).
- DNS (Domain Name System) connects your domain name to your web host's servers.

#### Deployment and File Transfer

To get your website files onto your web host's servers, you'll typically use:

- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
- Web-based file managers provided by your host
- Git-based deployment for more advanced setups

#### Advanced Hosting Concepts

##### Static File Hosting

Static file hosting is a simple and efficient way to serve websites that don't require server-side processing.

- Ideal for static websites built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Typically faster and more secure than dynamic hosting.
- Often cheaper and easier to scale.
- Popular static hosting services include:
  - Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/)
  - GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/)
  - Vercel (https://vercel.com/)
  - AWS S3 with CloudFront (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

##### Nginx Web Server

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a popular open-source web server that can also act as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache.

- Known for its high performance, stability, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.
- Often used to serve static files directly and proxy requests for dynamic content to application servers.
- Key features:
  - Event-driven architecture for handling multiple connections
  - Reverse proxy with caching
  - Load balancing
  - SSL/TLS termination
  - WebSocket support

Basic Nginx configuration for serving static files:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/example.com;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

##### Load Balancing

Load balancing is the practice of distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much demand.

- Improves application responsiveness and availability.
- Prevents any single server from becoming a point of failure.
- Can be implemented at different levels: DNS, network, and application.

Types of load balancing algorithms:

1. **Round Robin**: Requests are distributed sequentially to each server.
2. **Least Connections**: Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
3. **IP Hash**: The client's IP address determines which server receives the request.
4. **Weighted Round Robin/Least Connections**: Servers are assigned different weights based on their capabilities.

Example of Nginx as a load balancer:

```nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
        server backend3.example.com;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}
```

##### Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

CDNs are a network of geographically distributed servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

- Improves website load times by serving content from servers closest to the user.
- Reduces bandwidth costs and improves availability and redundancy.
- Popular CDN providers include Cloudflare, Akamai, and Amazon CloudFront.

##### Containerization and Orchestration

Modern web hosting often involves containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

- **Docker**: Allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a container.
- **Kubernetes**: Automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

These technologies can provide more flexibility and efficiency in hosting complex, distributed applications.

## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

### HTML Brief Introduction

#### What is HTML?

HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

Key points about HTML:

- It's not a programming language, but a markup language
- It uses tags to define elements within a document
- HTML documents are the backbone of most web pages
- Browsers use HTML to determine how to display the content of a web page

#### Brief History of HTML

HTML has evolved significantly since its inception:

1. **1989-1991**: Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web and created HTML as a way to structure documents for it.

2. **1995**: HTML 2.0 was published, the first standard HTML specification.

3. **1997**: HTML 3.2 became a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) recommendation, introducing tables and applets.

4. **1999**: HTML 4.01 was released, separating structure from presentation and encouraging the use of CSS for styling.

### HTML Syntax and Structure

#### Fundamentals: Tags, Attributes, and Elements

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is built on three core concepts: **tags**, **attributes**, and **elements**.

##### Tags

Tags are markup codes that define the structure and purpose of content in an HTML document.

- Enclosed in angle brackets: `< >`
- Usually come in pairs: opening tag and closing tag
- Closing tags include a forward slash: `</>`

Examples:
- Opening tag: `<p>`
- Closing tag: `</p>`
- Self-closing tag: `<img>` or `<br>`
- Syntax: `<tagname>content</tagname>`

##### Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

- Specified in the opening tag
- Syntax: Come in name/value pairs: `name="value"`
- Common attributes (id, class, style)
- Boolean attributes

Example:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape">
```
Here, `src` and `alt` are attributes of the `<img>` tag.

##### Elements

An element is the complete unit of content in an HTML document.

Components of an element:
- Opening tag
- Attributes (if any)
- Content
- Closing tag

Example:
```html
<p class="intro">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

#### Block and Inline Elements

In HTML, elements are typically classified into two main categories: block-level elements and inline elements. Understanding the difference between these two types is crucial for proper page layout and styling.

##### Block-level Elements

Block-level elements have the following characteristics:

- Start on a new line
- Take up the full width available by default
- Have a top and bottom margin

Common block-level elements include:

- `<div>`
- `<p>`
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`
- `<ul>` and `<ol>`
- `<section>`
- `<article>`

Example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<div>This is a div element.</div>
```

##### Inline Elements

Inline elements have the following characteristics:

- Do not start on a new line
- Only take up as much width as necessary
- Do not have top and bottom margins

Common inline elements include:

- `<span>`
- `<a>`
- `<strong>`
- `<em>`
- `<img>`
- `<br>`
- `<input>`

Example:
```html
<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red</span> word in a paragraph.</p>
```

> **Note**: 
> 
> All block-level elements have an opening and closing tags. As a result, self-enclosing elements are inline elements. (eg. `<input>`, `<img>`, `<br>`)
> 
> Exceptions to the block/inline elements: list items for the `<li>`, table, table rows, table cells for `<table>`, `<tr>` and `<td>` respectively

##### Changing Display Behavior

You can change how an element behaves using CSS. The `display` property can be used to make a block-level element behave like an inline element, or vice versa:

```css
/* Make a div behave like an inline element */
div {
    display: inline;
}

/* Make a span behave like a block-level element */
span {
    display: block;
}
```

##### Inline-Block

There's also a hybrid display value called `inline-block`. Elements with this display value:

- Flow with the text (like inline elements)
- Can have width and height set (like block elements)

```css
.inline-block-example {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
}
```

#### HTML Structure Hierarchy

##### Concepts of Relationships between Elements

```html
<div id="parent">
  <h1>Welcome to <span class="highlight">Our Website</span></h1>
  <p>We have <strong>amazing</strong> content for <em>you</em>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Item <a href="#">One</a></li>
    <li>Item <span style="color: red;">Two</span></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

Now, let's explain the relationships and nesting:

1. **Block-level elements**:
    - `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` are block-level elements.

2. **Inline elements**:
    - `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, and `<a>` are inline elements.

3. **Nesting**:
    - Inline elements (`<span>`) are nested within the block-level `<h1>`.
    - Multiple inline elements (`<strong>` and `<em>`) are nested within the `<p>`.
    - Inline elements (`<a>` and `<span>`) are nested within block-level `<li>` elements.

4. **Parent-Child relationships**:
   - The `<div>` is a parent to `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<ul>`.
   - The `<h1>` is a parent to the nested `<span>`.
   - The `<p>` is a parent to the nested `<strong>` and `<em>`.
   - Each `<li>` is a parent to its nested inline element (`<a>` or `<span>`).

5. **Siblings**:
    - The `<h1>`, `<p>` and `<ul>` are siblings within the `<div>`.
    - The inline `<strong>` and `<em>` within the `<p>` are siblings.

6. **Ancestors and Descendants**:
    - The `<div>` is an ancestor to all nested elements, including both block-level and inline elements.
    - All elements within the `<div>` are descendants of the `<div>`, regardless of whether they are block-level or inline.

##### Basic HTML Structure

Every HTML document follows a standard structure. Let's break down the essential components of an HTML document.

###### 1. DOCTYPE Declaration

Every HTML5 document starts with a DOCTYPE declaration. This tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

- It's not case-sensitive, but it's common practice to write it in uppercase.
- Unlike in older HTML versions, this declaration is simple and doesn't require a reference to a DTD (Document Type Definition).

###### 2. HTML Root Element

The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page. All other elements must be descendants of this element.

```html
<html lang="en">
  <!-- Other elements go here -->
</html>
```

- The `lang` attribute specifies the language of the document. It's important for accessibility and search engines.

###### 3. Head Section

The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page.

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
```

Key elements within the `<head>`:

- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding for the document (typically UTF-8).
- `<meta name="viewport">`: Ensures proper rendering on mobile devices.
- `<title>`: Specifies a title for the page, which is shown in the browser's title bar or page's tab.

Other common elements in the `<head>`:
- `<link>`: to link to external stylesheets
- `<script>`: to include JavaScript files or code
- `<style>`: to include internal CSS

###### 4. Body Section

The `<body>` element defines the document's body. It contains all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

```html
<body>
  <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <!-- More content goes here -->
</body>
```

###### 5. Putting It All Together

Here's an example of a basic HTML5 document structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph on my web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

This structure provides the foundation upon which you'll build more complex web pages and applications. As you progress, you'll add more elements within this basic structure, but the core components outlined here will remain consistent across most HTML documents you create.

### DOM (Document Object Model)

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree-like hierarchy of objects, allowing programs to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web documents.

#### Basic Concepts

##### 1. Node

A Node is the most basic unit in the DOM tree. Every object in the DOM hierarchy is a type of Node. Nodes can represent elements, text, comments, or other parts of the document. The Node interface provides properties and methods that are inherited by more specific node types.

##### 2. Element

An Element is a specific type of Node that represents an HTML or XML element in the document. Elements can have attributes, child nodes, and can be manipulated using various DOM methods. Examples of elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<a>` tags.

##### 3. Document

The Document object represents the entire HTML or XML document. It serves as the root of the DOM tree and provides methods to access and manipulate the document's content, structure, and styles. The document object is the entry point for working with the DOM.

##### 4. Window

The Window object represents the browser window or tab. It is the global object in client-side JavaScript and contains properties and methods for controlling the browser window, managing the document, and interacting with the user. The window object is the top-level object in the browser's JavaScript hierarchy.

#### Key Characteristics

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Represents documents as a tree of `Nodes`.
2. **Language-Independent**: Can be used with any programming language.
3. **Platform-Independent**: Works across different operating systems and devices.
4. **Dynamic**: Allows real-time updates to document content and structure.

#### Accessing DOM Elements

- `getElementById()`: Finds an element by its ID.
- `getElementsByClassName()`: Returns a collection of elements with a specific class.
- `getElementsByTagName()`: Returns a collection of elements with a specific tag name.
- `querySelector()`: Returns the first element that matches a CSS selector.
- `querySelectorAll()`: Returns all elements that match a CSS selector.

#### DOM Manipulation

- **Creating Elements**: `document.createElement()`
- **Modifying Elements**:
    - Changing content: `element.textContent`, `element.innerHTML`
    - Modifying attributes: `element.setAttribute()`, `element.removeAttribute()`
- **Adding/Removing Elements**:
    - `element.appendChild()`, `element.removeChild()`, `element.replaceChild()`
- **Changing Style**:
    - `element.style.color = 'red';`, `element.style.fontSize = '16px';`
- **Adding/Removing Classes**:
    - `element.classList.add('newClass');`, `element.classList.remove('oldClass');`

#### Traversing the DOM

- **Parent Node**: `element.parentNode;`
- **Child Node**: `element.childNodes;`
- **Sibling Nodes**:
    - `element.nextSibling;`
    - `element.previousSibling;`

#### Event Handling

The DOM allows attaching event listeners to elements:
```javascript
element.addEventListener('click', function() {
    // Event handler code
});
```

#### DOM API Examples
```javascript
// Selecting an element
let header = document.getElementById('main-header');

// Modifying content
header.textContent = 'New Header Text';

// Creating and appending a new element
let newParagraph = document.createElement('p');
newParagraph.textContent = 'This is a new paragraph.';
document.body.appendChild(newParagraph);

// Adding an event listener
header.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Header was clicked!');
});
```

### The Elements of HTML

#### The Root Element: \<html\> 

The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page. It encapsulates all other elements and tells the browser that this is an HTML document.

```html
<html lang="en">
  <!-- All other elements go here -->
</html>
```

- The `lang` attribute specifies the language of the document.

#### The Document Metadata

##### The Element: \<head\>

The `<head>` element represents a collection of metadata for the Document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="A comprehensive guide to HTML elements">
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, web development, tutorial">
    <meta name="author" content="beengo">
    <title>Comprehensive HTML Guide</title>
    <script>
        function greet() {
            alert('Hello, World!');
        }
    </script>
    <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            line-height: 1.6;
        }
    </style>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/styles.css">
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://example.com/fr/" hreflang="fr-FR">
</head>
<body>
<!-- Page content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

##### HTML Meta Information

Meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document. They are used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

###### Character Encoding

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

This declares the character encoding for the HTML document, ensuring proper text rendering.

###### Viewport Settings

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

This meta tag ensures proper rendering on mobile devices by setting the viewport width to the device width and initial zoom level.

###### Description, Keywords and Author
```html
<meta name="description" content="A comprehensive guide to HTML elements">
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, web development, tutorial">
<meta name="author" content="beego">
```

These meta tags help search engines understand and index your page content, and specifies the author of the web page.

##### The Element: \<title\>

The `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page, which is shown in the browser's title bar or page's tab.

##### The Element: \<script\>

The `<script>` element is used to embed or reference JavaScript code within an HTML document.

- Inline JavaScript:
```html
<script>
  // Your JavaScript code here
  function greet() {
    alert('Hello, World!');
  }
</script>
```

- External JavaScript:
```html
<script src="path/to/your/script.js"></script>
```

###### Attributes of \<script\>

- `src`: Specifies the URL of an external script file.
- `type`: Specifies the MIME type of the script (default is "text/javascript").
- `async`: Script is downloaded asynchronously and executed as soon as it's available.
- `defer`: Script is downloaded asynchronously but executed only after the document has finished loading.


##### The Element: \<style\>

The `<style>` element is used to define CSS styles directly within an HTML document.

###### Attributes of \<style\>

- `type`: Specifies the MIME type of the style sheet (default is "text/css").
- `media`: Specifies on which media/device the styles should be applied.

##### The Element: \<link\>

The `<link>` element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. It's most commonly used to link to external CSS files. You can also use it to link to favicon, alternate versions of the document, and more.

```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/styles.css">
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://example.com/fr/" hreflang="fr-FR">
```

The address of the link(s) is given by the `href` attribute. If the href attribute is present, then its value must be a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces. One or both of the `href` or `imagesrcset` attributes must be present.

If both the `href` and `imagesrcset` attributes are absent, then the element does not define a link.
