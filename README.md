## Web Basics
### The Internet in a Nutshell

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that has revolutionized how we communicate, access information, and conduct business. At its core, it's a vast system that allows data to be transmitted between devices anywhere in the world.

#### Key Components

1. **Infrastructure**: The physical layer of the Internet.
    - Fiber optic cables (e.g., transatlantic cables like MAREA)
    - Satellite networks (e.g., Starlink)
    - Cellular networks (4G, 5G)
    - Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)

2. **Protocols**: Standardized rules for data communication.
    - TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

3. **Servers**: High-performance computers that store, process, and distribute data.
    - Web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
    - Database servers (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    - Application servers (e.g., Tomcat, Node.js)

4. **Clients**: End-user devices that request and receive data.
    - Desktop computers, smartphones, IoT devices

#### Key Concepts

##### 1. IP Address

A numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

- **IPv4**: 32-bit address space (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address space (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

```
IPv4: 192.168.1.1
IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334 (compressed form)
```

##### 2. Domain

Human-readable names mapped to IP addresses through the Domain Name System.

- **Structure**: `[subdomain.]domain.TLD`
- **Example**: `www.example.com`
    - `www` - subdomain
    - `example` - second-level domain
    - `com` - Top-Level Domain (TLD)

##### 3. URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

A reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.

- **Structure**: `scheme:[//[user:password@]host[:port]][/]path[?query][#fragment]`
- **Example**: `https://api.example.com:8080/v1/users?active=true#info`
    - `https://` - scheme
    - `api.example.com` - host
    - `:8080` - port
    - `/v1/users` - path
    - `?active=true` - query
    - `#info` - fragment

##### 4. Protocol

A set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices.

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems
- **FTP**: Standard network protocol used for file transfer between a client and server
- **SMTP**: Internet standard for email transmission

##### 5. DNS (Domain Name System)

A hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.

- **Process**:
    1. User enters "www.example.com" in browser
    2. Recursive DNS resolver queries root nameserver
    3. Root server responds with TLD nameserver (.com)
    4. TLD nameserver provides authoritative nameserver for example.com
    5. Authoritative nameserver returns IP address for www.example.com
    6. Resolver returns IP address to client
    7. Client establishes connection with the IP address

```shell
dig +trace www.example.com
```

This command demonstrates the DNS resolution process, showing each step from root to authoritative nameserver.

### The World Wide Web

The **World Wide Web (WWW)**, commonly known as the Web, is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. It has revolutionized the way people communicate, access information, and conduct business globally. Invented by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, the Web has become an integral part of modern life and has transformed nearly every aspect of society.


#### Key Components of the Web

1. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**: The standard language used to create web pages.
2. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: The protocol for transmitting data over the Web.
3. **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)**: Unique addresses for web resources.
4. **Web browsers**: Software applications used to access and navigate the Web.
5. **Web servers**: Computers that host websites and respond to requests from browsers.

#### Evolution of the Web

##### Web 1.0 (1989-2004)
- Static HTML websites
- Limited user interaction
- One-way communication from website to user

##### Web 2.0 (2004-2014)
- Dynamic, interactive websites
- User-generated content (blogs, wikis, social media)
- Cloud computing and mobile web

##### Web 3.0 (2014-present)
- Semantic Web and AI integration

### Web Browser Architecture

#### Core Components of a Web Browser

Modern web browsers are complex pieces of software composed of several key components:

1. User Interface
2. Browser Engine
3. Rendering Engine
4. JavaScript Engine
5. Networking Component
6. UI Backend
7. Data Storage

For developers, the most relevant components are the Browser Engine, Rendering Engine, and JavaScript Engine.

#### Browser and Rendering Engines

The Browser Engine (also known as the Layout Engine) is responsible for coordinating between the UI, the rendering engine, and other parts of the browser.

The Rendering Engine is responsible for displaying the requested content. It parses HTML and CSS and displays the parsed content on the screen.

The main rendering engines are:

1. **Blink**: An open-source engine developed as part of the Chromium project. It powers:
    - Google Chrome
    - Microsoft Edge (since 2020)
    - Opera (since 2013)
    - Brave
    - Vivaldi
    - Many other Chromium-based browsers

2. **Gecko**: An open-source engine developed by Mozilla. It powers:
    - Firefox
    - Tor Browser

3. **WebKit**: An open-source engine developed by Apple. It powers:
    - Safari
    - All browsers on iOS (due to Apple's restrictions)

#### JavaScript Engines

The JavaScript Engine is a crucial component that parses and executes JavaScript code. The main JavaScript engines are:

1. **V8**: Developed by Google, used in:
    - Google Chrome
    - Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.)
    - Node.js

2. **SpiderMonkey**: Developed by Mozilla, used in:
    - Firefox

3. **JavaScriptCore** (also known as Nitro): Developed by Apple, used in:
    - Safari
    - Other WebKit-based browsers

4. **Chakra**: Developed by Microsoft, formerly used in Internet Explorer and pre-Chromium Microsoft Edge

#### The Relationship Between Engines

It's important to note that rendering engines and JavaScript engines work together but are separate components:

- Chrome and Chromium-based browsers use Blink for rendering and V8 for JavaScript execution.
- Firefox uses Gecko for rendering and SpiderMonkey for JavaScript.
- Safari uses WebKit for rendering and JavaScriptCore for JavaScript.

#### Impact on Web Development

1. **Performance Optimization**: Different engines may have varying performance characteristics, affecting how your code runs.

2. **Feature Support**: New web APIs and features might be implemented in some engines before others.

3. **Debugging**: Browser-specific developer tools are tailored to their respective engines.

4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Despite increasing standardization, differences between engines can still cause inconsistencies in how web pages are rendered or how JavaScript behaves.

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Knowing the capabilities of different engines helps in implementing graceful fallbacks for unsupported features.

##### The Trend Towards Engine Consolidation

In recent years, there's been a trend towards consolidation in the browser engine landscape, with many browsers adopting Blink and V8:

- **Benefits**: More consistent rendering and JavaScript behavior across many browsers, potentially simplifying development and testing.
- **Concerns**: Reduced diversity in the browser ecosystem, which some argue could lead to a single entity having too much influence over web standards.

##### Staying Informed

As a web developer, it's crucial to stay updated on the latest developments in browser engines:

- Follow browser release notes and roadmaps
- Participate in beta testing programs for major browsers
- Keep an eye on Web Standards discussions and proposals

### Web Hosting: Bringing Your Website to Life

Once you've developed your website, the next crucial step is to make it accessible to users on the internet. This is where web hosting comes in. This chapter will explore the concept of web hosting, different types of hosting services, and key considerations for choosing the right hosting solution for your project.

#### What is Web Hosting?

Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide the technologies and services needed for a website to be viewed on the internet.

#### How Web Hosting Works

1. You create your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).
2. You upload these files to a web server provided by your hosting company.
3. The web host connects your site to the internet, making it accessible to users worldwide.
4. When someone types your domain name into their browser, the browser contacts the web server and requests your website files.
5. The server sends these files back to the user's browser, which then renders the website.

#### Domain Names and DNS

While not strictly part of hosting, domain names are closely related:

- A domain name is your website's address on the internet (e.g., www.example.com).
- You typically purchase domain names separately from your hosting (though some hosts offer them as a package).
- DNS (Domain Name System) connects your domain name to your web host's servers.

#### Deployment and File Transfer

To get your website files onto your web host's servers, you'll typically use:

- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
- Web-based file managers provided by your host
- Git-based deployment for more advanced setups

#### Advanced Hosting Concepts

##### Static File Hosting

Static file hosting is a simple and efficient way to serve websites that don't require server-side processing.

- Ideal for static websites built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Typically faster and more secure than dynamic hosting.
- Often cheaper and easier to scale.
- Popular static hosting services include:
  - Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/)
  - GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/)
  - Vercel (https://vercel.com/)
  - AWS S3 with CloudFront (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

##### Nginx Web Server

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a popular open-source web server that can also act as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache.

- Known for its high performance, stability, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.
- Often used to serve static files directly and proxy requests for dynamic content to application servers.
- Key features:
  - Event-driven architecture for handling multiple connections
  - Reverse proxy with caching
  - Load balancing
  - SSL/TLS termination
  - WebSocket support

Basic Nginx configuration for serving static files:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/example.com;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

##### Load Balancing

Load balancing is the practice of distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much demand.

- Improves application responsiveness and availability.
- Prevents any single server from becoming a point of failure.
- Can be implemented at different levels: DNS, network, and application.

Types of load balancing algorithms:

1. **Round Robin**: Requests are distributed sequentially to each server.
2. **Least Connections**: Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
3. **IP Hash**: The client's IP address determines which server receives the request.
4. **Weighted Round Robin/Least Connections**: Servers are assigned different weights based on their capabilities.

Example of Nginx as a load balancer:

```nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
        server backend3.example.com;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}
```

##### Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

CDNs are a network of geographically distributed servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

- Improves website load times by serving content from servers closest to the user.
- Reduces bandwidth costs and improves availability and redundancy.
- Popular CDN providers include Cloudflare, Akamai, and Amazon CloudFront.

##### Containerization and Orchestration

Modern web hosting often involves containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

- **Docker**: Allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a container.
- **Kubernetes**: Automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

These technologies can provide more flexibility and efficiency in hosting complex, distributed applications.
